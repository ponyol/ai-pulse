# AI-PULSE Project Purpose

## Overview
AI-PULSE is a **production-ready RSS monitoring system** for comprehensive Anthropic AI company updates. The project addresses critical gaps in existing RSS solutions that only cover basic news.

## Key Problems Solved
- **Missing Engineering Content**: Most RSS feeds skip `anthropic.com/engineering` technical insights
- **No Safety Research Coverage**: Critical `alignment.anthropic.com` safety research is unavailable  
- **Incomplete Research Access**: `anthropic.com/research` papers not monitored
- **Fragmented Monitoring**: No unified solution combining all Anthropic sources

## Target Users
- **DevOps Professionals**: Automated monitoring and alerting systems
- **AI Researchers**: Staying current with Anthropic's latest research and engineering insights
- **Safety-Concerned Teams**: Critical alignment and safety research updates
- **Technical Teams**: Engineering blog insights for AI system development

- **Complete Coverage**: 46+ articles vs 16 in existing solutions
- **Critical Safety Content**: 25+ alignment science articles (54% of total)
- **Automated Pipeline**: GitHub Actions every 4 hours + full Monday rescans
- **Desktop Integration**: macOS notifications, Gmail digests, priority filtering
- **Production Ready**: Robust error handling, caching, monitoring

## Success Metrics
- Articles monitored: **46 total** (News: 16, Engineering: 5, Alignment: 25)
- Performance: **3.4 seconds** full generation time
- Uptime: **99.9%** via GitHub Actions automation
- Coverage expansion ready for other AI companies (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.)
